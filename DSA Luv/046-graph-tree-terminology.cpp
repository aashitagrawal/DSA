// Topic - Graphs / Trees

// There are vertex and edges, joining two vertex, forms an edge
// A graph is  collection of vertex and edges, connected or unconnected
// Tree is a graph, without any loop
// In a tree, if there are 'N' vertex/nodes, then there will be 'N-1' edges

//Components - Subset of graphs
//All components in a graph togehter are called forest
//Strongly connected components - In a directed graph, you can jump from any vertex to any other vertex

//In a tree - depth is any nodes distance from root node, height of a node is distance from the lowest leaf node
// LCA - Loest Common Ancestor
