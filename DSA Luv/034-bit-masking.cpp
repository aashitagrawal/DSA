    // ðŸ’¡ Explaining what is bit masking
    /* Lets say you have four fruits
    apple - 0
    banana - 1
    lichi - 2
    mango - 3
    and three person, having some of those fruits
    person1 - apple,banana
    person2 - apple,lichi,mango
    person3 - apple, mango
    and you need to find max common friuts between all three person
    so bit mask person1 choices - 0011
    so bit mask person2 choices - 1101
    so bit mask person3 choices - 1001
    now find the BITWISE AND of these
    and we get - 0001 - so thats apple

    // ðŸ’¡ QUESTION
    // Consider this problem: There are Nâ‰¤5000 workers. Each worker is available during some days of this month (which has 30 days).
    // For each worker, you are given a set of numbers, each from interval [1,30] , representing his/her availability.
    // You need to assign an important project to two workers but they will be able to work on the project only when they are both available.
    // Find two workers that are best for the job â€” maximize the number of days when both these workers are available
